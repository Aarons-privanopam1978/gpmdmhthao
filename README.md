Just out of the theater, lights too bright, air sticky and filled with the crumbs of popcorn. Dual, man, it’s like this weird dream you only half remember but definitely felt real, you know? Sat on this annoyingly cold bench now, back's grumbling at me like an old dog. 

So, about this   – a loop de loop of madness and existential dread, but wrapped in this bizarrely elegant package. The noises in the theater were all around – like the sound of a thousand hair dryers going at once, pretty fitting I guess. There's this scene where she, the main chick, stands facing her double - it's eerier than when you look at those haircut mannequin heads in the back room at work and swear they blink at you. My head's full of static.

> Oh, and someone was munching on popcorn so loudly near me, it felt like a freakin' percussion solo, kept pulling me out whenever I was deep into the plot. Or was it the other way around? The plot pulling me out of that popcorn trance? Who knows, spaghetti brain right now. Can’t think.

Certain moments there felt like they were teasing the dark comedy in everyday snips of life. Like finding out your client has been secretly seeing another hairdresser. The nerve! The nerve, just like the nerve of seeing your own face looking back at you but not being you. Makes sense? Probably not. You gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   to get what I'm saying.

Halfway through I remembered, did someone text me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Or was that just a thought passing through like those clouds you can never quite decipher. Anyway, good luck 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨—wait, no, just see it in a theater if you can, even with the chewing noises lurking around.

If 'identity crisis' was a haircut, this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 would be the avant-garde asymmetrical bob I did for Claire – only half makes sense but damn, does it make a statement! Too bold for its own right yet impossible to look away, just like your duplicate self wearing your life better than you ever did. My head's spinning harder than one of those swivel salon chairs. 

Ugh. Curtains. Dual-clones-doubles-dual-duel. Words loop like hair strands brushed out of a comb. Lost my point somewhere. Or did I have one? God, so many layers like an undercut gone awry.
